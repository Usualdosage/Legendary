    <h1>Welcome to Legendary!</h1>
    <p>
        We're glad you're here, and we want to make this playing experience as fun as possible! Legendary is a multi-player online role-playing game. The content
        is largely text-based with some images here and there to enhance the experience. We enforce (and reward) roleplaying, so please, play your character well!
    </p>
    <p>
        Lost? That's ok, we're here to help. You can access this help at any type by simply typing HELP NEWBIE and pressing enter (it doesn't have to be all capitals!).
    </p>
    <h2>Navigating</h2>
    <p>
        Generally, your options will be NORTH, SOUTH, EAST, WEST, UP, and DOWN. You can move you character in this direction by simply typing the first character of the
        direction you want to go, and pressing ENTER.
    </p>
    <h2>Communicating</h2>
    <p>
        There are several options for communication. You can SAY, YELL, TELL, or PRAY. For example, if you type "say hello" (no need to include the quotes), your character will, well, say Hello.
        A tell is like a telepathic command that creates a private conversation between you and another player. If you yell, the whole area will hear you. And if you pray, the
        immortals, the staff of this game, will likely hear you.
